## Integration Points

### 1. **Enhanced NL2SQL Prompt**
- Added business rules context to the NL2SQL conversion prompt
- Updated examples to use actual table names and business terminology
- Improved accuracy for domain-specific queries

### 2. **Updated Query Examples** 
Added 14 new business rule-aware examples:

**NL2SQL Examples:**
```sql
-- Business rule: PI = Personal time off
"Show me PI absences" â†’ SELECT * FROM absence WHERE absence_reason = 'PI'

-- Business rule: active field for status  
"Find active activities" â†’ SELECT * FROM activity WHERE active = 'true'

-- Business rule: User-activity relationships
"Show user activity assignments" â†’ SELECT u.username, COUNT(ua.activity_id) 
FROM user u JOIN user_activities ua ON u.id = ua.user_id
```

### 3. **Enhanced Query Categories**
Added 4 new business-specific categories with 11 queries:

#### ðŸ“Š **Favorites and Templates** (3 queries)
- Favorite entries by user (template usage)
- Favorite days configuration analysis  
- Recent favorite entries by location

#### ðŸ“Š **Activity Analysis** (2 queries)
- Activities by type and status
- Activity usage by users

#### ðŸ“Š **Compliance Reporting** (3 queries)
- Posting date compliance tracking
- Manager workload distribution
- User access audit by location

#### ðŸ“Š **Data Quality** (3 queries) 
- Users without locations

### 4. **Enhanced Table Descriptions**
Updated schema descriptions with business context:

```sql
-- User accounts and authentication information for the time management system
CREATE TABLE user (...)

-- Activities and tasks - includes types like REGULAR, OVERTIME, VACATION, SICK, etc.
CREATE TABLE activity (...)

-- Core time tracking records with status workflow (favorites system)
CREATE TABLE favorite_entry (...)

-- Payroll posting periods with cut-off dates for time entry submission  
CREATE TABLE posting_date (...)
```

## Testing Results

### **NL2SQL Accuracy Improved**
Successfully tested 5 business rule-aware queries:

1. âœ… **"Show me PI absences"** â†’ Correctly used `WHERE absence_reason = 'PI'`

3. âœ… **"Show user activity assignments"** â†’ Properly joined user and user_activities tables
4. âœ… **"Which users have manager relationships?"** â†’ Correctly used user_manager table
5. âœ… **"Show calculation rates by type"** â†’ Properly grouped by type field

### **Query Categories Expanded**
- **Total Categories**: 9 (up from 6)
- **Total Query Examples**: 23 (up from 14)  
- **Business-Specific Queries**: 11 new queries
- **Coverage**: All major business areas covered
