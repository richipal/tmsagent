## Training Examples Added

### **üìö Comprehensive SQL Examples Coverage**
Added **9 high-quality SQL examples** covering diverse business scenarios:

#### **üîç Basic Queries (2 examples)**
- **"List all the 21st century activity codes"** - Pattern matching in descriptions
- **"What is the current payroll period?"** - Active record filtering

#### **üîó Join Queries (5 examples)**
- **"Which location does Rosalinda Rodriguez work at?"** - Employee-location relationship
- **"Which locations have the most time entries?"** - Location usage analysis
- **"What are the most used activity codes?"** - Activity frequency analysis
- **"Show me employees who worked overtime last month"** - Multi-table overtime tracking
- **"Show me pending time entries for approval for location 061"** - Workflow by location

#### **‚è±Ô∏è Time Calculation Queries (2 examples)**
- **"How many hours did Rosalinda Rodriguez work in total throughout years?"** - Complex time logic
- **"Show me the top 5 employees by hours worked"** - Performance ranking with calculations

### **üéØ Advanced SQL Patterns Demonstrated**

#### **Time Calculation Logic**
```sql
SUM(
    CASE 
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, begin_date_time, end_date_time) = 0 
            THEN unit 
        ELSE TRUNCATE(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, begin_date_time, end_date_time)/60, 2) 
    END
) AS total_hours
```
- **Business Rule**: If time difference is 0, use the unit field, otherwise calculate hours
- **Accuracy**: Handles edge cases in time tracking
- **Performance**: Efficient calculation using built-in functions

#### **Case-Insensitive Employee Search**
```sql
WHERE LCASE(e.first_name) LIKE LCASE('%Rosalinda%') 
AND LCASE(e.last_name) LIKE LCASE('%Rodriguez%')
```
- **Flexibility**: Works regardless of name capitalization
- **User-Friendly**: Natural name searching patterns
- **Robust**: Handles partial name matches

#### **Multi-Table Relationship Joins**
```sql
FROM employee e 
JOIN time_entry te ON e.id = te.employee_id 
JOIN activity a ON te.activity_id = a.id 
JOIN location l ON e.location_id = l.id
```
- **Comprehensive**: Links all core business entities
- **Accurate**: Proper foreign key relationships
- **Performance**: Efficient join patterns

#### **Workflow Status Management**
```sql
WHERE te.status_id = 1  -- SENT_FOR_APPROVAL
AND l.code = '061'
```
- **Business Logic**: Uses workflow status codes (0-4)
- **Location-Specific**: Combines workflow with location filtering
- **Practical**: Real-world approval scenarios

#### **Date Range Analysis**
```sql
WHERE te.begin_date_time >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
AND te.status_id = 4  -- POSTED
```
- **Temporal**: Recent data analysis patterns
- **Status-Aware**: Only includes completed/posted entries
- **Dynamic**: Uses relative date calculations

## Categorization System
